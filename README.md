<h4>Food in relation to Healthy Living.</h4>

<p> Food is very important to us human beings. It gives us energy and boosts the overall functioning of the body. Our brains require food to think and perform the needed functions. Food protects the body from diseases, because it boosts the body's immune system, and fights diseases.</p>
               
<p>Food prevents many diseases and helps the body function well which results to a healthy life. Food is classified into different groups which are vitamins, carbohydrates and proteins. Carbohydrates give us energy to work, think and do different tasks. Vitamins protect the body from diseases. Proteins are also very important as they help repair and build the body's cells.</p>

<p>Food is that major source of energy. Energy comes from the food we eat. Food protects the body from diseases. It also helps people not to get sick. Energy is very important to the body. It helps a person to accomplish the daily activities. A person with good energy levels is more productive   than a person with low energy levels. </p>

<p>People are different when it comes to energy levels. A person who eats a good well balanced diet has got higher energy levels than a person who does not eat food. According to Allison, Tsai(2024), food gives us energy and promotes life. Without food a person cannot have a good life or live longer. </p>

<p>Our brains need food. Brains need food to help a person think we'll, perform , and to function well overall. Without food the body cannot get energy. Energy helps the body to respond well to its functions. Example, energy helps a person to talk, think,walk,run,read, and even sing, says Allison Tsai (2024).</p>

<p>Food can be grouped into different categories.We have carbohydrates,proteins,vitamins, fruits,fibre, and roughages.Examples of carbohydrates include rice, chapati, mandazi, and both sweet and Irish potatoes. Without carbohydrates, we would not have energy to do many different tasks as all tasks require energy.

<p>Another group, vitamins, keep us healthy. These include fruits and vegetables like oranges, apples, mangoes, guavas, pineapples, kales, spinach, pumpkin leaves and cabbages, to name but a few.</p>

<p>We also need proteins to help repair and build our body cells. Cells, like everything else, need to be repaired and built. Proteins are responsible for doing this job and they include chicken, mutton, beef, fish, eggs and beans.</p>

<p>Having a healthy life needs a well balanced diet. Healthy living promotes a happy living. According to the 2020 Dietary guidelines for Americans, says a well balanced food should contain all food components.</p>

<p>Avoid dehydration. Start your day with a warm cup of water. Daily the recommended cups of water should be 8-10 cups of drinking boiled water. Water performs many body functions. It promotes  in digestion, removal of body toxins, boosts appetite and promotes skin rejuvenation.</p>

<p>Avoid food with added sugars or excessive sugar.Sugar is not healthy to the body.It weakens then body cells and prepares a fertile ground of diseases.Excess sugar dehydrates the skin.

<p> We have natural sugars to be obtained from fruits and other natural foods such as sweet potatoes. Excessive sugar makes your body a fertile ground of diseases. It weakens the body immune system and dehydrates the skin as says Allison Tsai (2024). Water helps your heart to perfom its functions well hence boosts the body’s energy levels.
